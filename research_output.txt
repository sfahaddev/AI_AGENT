The history of Pakistan spans thousands of years, from the ancient Indus Valley Civilization to the present day. 
The region has been home to various cultures, including the Vedic period, the Persian Empire, the Mauryan Empire, 
the Islamic Golden Age, and the British Raj. In the 20th century, Pakistan was formed as an independent nation through the efforts of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, 
who is considered the founder of the country.
